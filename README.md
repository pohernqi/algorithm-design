Dataset 1 (For implementation in Q2) Write an algorithm to generate 6 sets of data with random numeric seeding. Use group leader’s ID as the random seed reference to generate dataset of size(s) as follows: 
Set 1: 100 
Set 2: 1,000 
Set 3: 10,000 
Set 4: 100,000 
Set 5: 500,000 
Set 6: 1,000,000 

Store random seeded dataset(s)/input(s) in e.g. txt file(s). 

Dataset 2 (For implementation in Q3 and Q4) You are assigned to assist in designing locations of stars with values of each star should hold for a star conquer quest. In order to ensure the feasibility for participants to win the conquer quest with designed stars’ locations, theoretical analyses need to be conducted.  Write an algorithm to generate dataset for 20 locations of stars (vertices) with 54 routes (edges) that connect between the stars. Each star needs to at least connect to 3 other stars. Use the sum of other group  members’  ID  number  to  generate  data  consisting  of  values  for  star  name,  x-coordinate,  y-coordinate, z-coordinate, weight and profit. The weight and profit refer to the points to be collected from conquering the star.

Use Dataset 1 for implementation of Heap Sort and Selection Sort Algorithms. Heap Sort  Store  the  data  in  a  priority  queue  using  a  heap.  Store  sorted  dataset(s)/output(s)  in  e.g.  txt  file(s). Record the time to insert all data into the priority queue. Dequeue the data to test the timing of the priority queue. Plot the graph of timing vs dataset size and discuss about the time and space complexity of the algorithm. Selection Sort Sort the dataset(s) using selection sort. Store sorted dataset(s)/output(s) in e.g. txt file(s). Record the time to complete sorting of data. Plot the graph of timing vs dataset size and discuss about the time and space complexity of the algorithm.

Use Dataset 2 for the implementation of Dijkstra’s and Kruskal’s Algorithm. Shortest Paths  Write a program to identify the shortest paths from Star A to the other stars using Dijkstra’s Algorithm. Then display the shortest distance to each star (store the output(s) in e.g. txt file(s)). Draw the graph representing the shortest paths. Discuss about the time and space complexity of the algorithm. Minimum Spanning Tree  Write a program to identify the Minimum Spanning Tree using Kruskal’s Algorithm. Display the edges of the tree and draw the graph representing the Minimum Spanning Tree (store the output(s) in e.g. txt file(s)). Discuss about the time and space complexity of the algorithm

Use Dataset 2 for the implementation of 0/1 Knapsack Algorithm. Dynamic Programming  Assume  that  each  participant  travels  in  a  spaceship  which  have  maximum  capacity  of  conquering 800kg of stars. Write a program to identify the set of star(s) to visit without returning to beginning star location using the 0/1 Knapsack Algorithm (assume that once the participant reach a star, participant has to conquer and plunder the full weight of that star). Draft out the resulting matrix and the list of stars to visit, with the weights and profits from each star to be winner of the star conquer quest (store the output(s) in e.g. txt file(s)). Discuss about the time and space complexity of the algorithm.
